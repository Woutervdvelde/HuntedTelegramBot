# Hunted Telegram Bot
![HuntedTelegramIcon](/icon.png)
This Telegram has been created as practise with the Telegram bot API. Someone requested met to make an application that sends a location of one person every x minutes. Used for a real life game called (in Dutch) "jachtseizoen". Since Telegram already has a build in live location share feature it was a nobrainer to create a Telegram bot as solution.

### Usage
Simply copy the .env and add your Telegram bot token. The only command currently is `/start`. This starts the game, everything else can be managed through Telegrams [`Inline Keyboard`](https://core.telegram.org/bots/2-0-intro).
